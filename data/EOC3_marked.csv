I am thankful that Becky took the time to reteach some of the lessons from last cohort as well as introduce new information and help us know what mistakes we are making so that we can make sure we are teaching the content correctly. The lunch and learn was awesome as always! Hopefully this makes sense since I cannot proofread before submitting. ðŸ™‚,Almost always,Seldom,Almost always,Almost always,eoc3
