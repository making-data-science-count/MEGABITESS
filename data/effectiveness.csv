Only other problem was some folks talked a lot and others did not get a chance to talk at all. The communications team breakout room was nice because someone actually realized that 1 person did not get a chance to talk and asked their opinion. So, having some equability in the conversations could be better. Maybe use a facilitator in the rooms next time?","Becky's mosquito powerpoints with embedded video clips! I loved the GIS Inquiries, but don't see one for my subject. Maybe I can modify one to work. ","The idea of pairing up the folks with lots of GIS experience/previous coursework with the beginners was really good! However; the time to practice the 1-1 was not nearly long enough. I get much more out of something if we are all on a level playing field. So, maybe even doing more for the beginners and slow down!!!","Overall very good. I may have missed the connection on Joshua Rosenberg's presentation. Not sure how the data was compiled, how it integrates with GIS and how we can use it. Is there a video tutorial for this? I am also wondering if the ""attributes"" (column headings) could be worded better? Meaning, that someone unfamiliar with the project could easily read the word and know exactly what data it represented. Bottom line for me is I need to spend more time playing with the GIS on my own."
