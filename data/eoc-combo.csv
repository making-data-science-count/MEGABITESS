It was great!! The GIS breakout was great!!! My partner and I worked so well together, and could have gotten much further together, vs. stopping it and going to the big group! I believe it was a win/win for both of us. Once the group started back, learnings went way down. Shift: Click and drag (glad someone else asked this question, because this has been a peeve of mine, can't wait to practice!) Lunch-n-Learn was OK, More about the broader aspect of ESRI, vs. tangible for our work. Although, he kept my interest and will be a great resource moving forward!!!! Journal Article to Policy Reports (I would love to hear more...); COPAD presentation??? I LOVE data and analysis of data; however, this presentation lost me from the beginning! What is COPAD? I googled it during the presentation. Also, went to the link provided to get our data. I totally understand x/y axis, etc... Just that the presentation left the station without all of the passengers on board. So, the conversation was very limited and let many out. I would strongly suggest in the future putting the high tech people in the morning and giving them more time to set up. Although the lunch-n-learn guy was good, it was more of an infomercial and wasted almost 2 hours that could have otherwise been used for Joshua to break down things better, and/or, for more GIS training and time for the one-to-one practice!",Occasionally,To a considerable degree,Occasionally,Occasionally,EOC4
